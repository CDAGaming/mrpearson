<h3>Browns Ranch Trail</h3>
Brown’s Ranch is a low-to-no tech riding adventure where you can roll through the desert at a good pace covering more miles than you thought possible by sunset. My advice for first timers to BR…
<p>
Hackamore! Start your ride off in style, with a big smile, by taking Hackamore westbound right from the road just outside the parking lot. You will be rewarded with a good mile of introductory flow trail before you even need to pedal. After the Hackamore honeymoon, stay on the perimeter trails for a solid adventure. Some mild climbing and plenty of fast turns. My suggested 22 mile route…
<p>
Clockwise: Hackamore, Cone, Upper Ranch, Corral, Dry Gulch, Cholla Mtn, Branding Iron, Granite Mountain Loop, to Bootlegger. Bootlegger, Saddle Horn, Granite mountain Loop, back up to Branding Iron and return on the perimeter back to the Trailhead. This lollipop loop is great fun and will give you a nice taste of the area in 22 miles.
<p>
Other can’t miss trails that offer sustained flowy XC descents are: Watershed to Whisky Bottle southbound and Latigo to Turpentine Eastbound. (Latigo out-n-back Eastbound is an even shorter introduction to the system. It starts with a short gradual climb though.) 136th Street Express southbound will teach you to corner on loose over hardpack for sure. My best rides out at Brown’s have been just after the rains when the trails are dishing out hero dirt. There are places that get muddy, so don’t ride too soon after a big rain.
