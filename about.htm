<p>Godzilla is a brainchild of the Information Technology class of 2004. The name 
  Godzilla was thought of by a student by the name of Victor Mercado. It was actually 
  part of an assignment where we set up a domain using Microsoft Server 2003 where 
  before the name &quot;Godzilla&quot; was brought up, boring names were used 
  such as &quot;Period 3&quot; or &quot;Period 4&quot;. </p>
<p>It is actually maintained by a web guru who lives in the East Indies. Any changes 
  made to Godzilla need to be brought to his attention. His email address is : 
  webguru@eastindies.godzilla.org.net.com.edu.mil. He owns the Internet.</p>
