<h3>Mountain Trail</h3>
The Bear Creek Trail provides a taste of the country in the city, connecting downtown Denver with the foothills of the Rockies. Along the way, enjoy scenic views of woodlands, meadows and Bear Creek, as well as the urban beauty of the Denver skyline.
<p>
The trail's western end offers tree-lined landscapes through Bear Creek Lake Park, Bear Creek Greenbelt and Bear Valley Park, while its eastern end provides a connection to shopping centers and commercial areas. Note that the path includes a variety of different surface types, from dirt and gravel to asphalt and concrete, including some single-tracking. To continue the journey, trail-goers can connect to the Platte River Trail in Denver.
