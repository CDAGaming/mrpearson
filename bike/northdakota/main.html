<h3>Maah Daah Hey Trail</h3>
The term "Maah-Daah-Hey" comes from the Mandan Indian language meaning "Grandfather" and the trail symbol of a "Turtle" comes from the Lakota Indian’s symbolic meaning of long life and patience. Construction of the 96-mile long Maah-Daah-Hey Trail began in 1995 and was finished in 1999 in accordance with a three-partner effort between the North Dakota State Parks and Recreation Department (NDPRD), Theodore Roosevelt National Park (TRNP) and the United States Forest Service (USFS).
<p>
This area is full of unique geological formations and cultural resources. Native Americans used the area for annual hunting trips from the surrounding prairie. The MDH Trail passes by Theodore Roosevelt's Elkhorn Ranch site on the Little Missouri River as well as General Sully's Trail and the CCC Historical Site. Since its inception, the Maah-Daah-Hey Trail has become recognized as a premier non-motorized trail and has been featured in many national publications.

<h3>Harmon Lake Trail</h3>
The trail makes a loop around Harmon Lake. Starting from the boat ramp hit the singletrack going across the dam. Once over the dam, the trail meanders in and out of tree groves for a while. The trail slowly starts to turn more into open rolling fields and fewer trees. 
<p>
Once across the bridge, you get into a lot of smooth flowing trail in these open fields with the occasional tree grove. The section from the dam to the bridge is the most difficult and after the bridge the trail is easier. The more difficult section is not that bad, so most people should be fine on the trail. 
<p>
There is no major climbing on this trail and nothing overly technical. Signage is good and seeing how it is a loop, it would be hard to get lost. There are some places with really scenic views of the lake, especially around sunset.
